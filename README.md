## Greetings! nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’—
I'm michael and I'm a software enthusiats and art enthusiats (kinda... I love drawing but sucks at it). I love doing learn about computer, especially by my own... I also like to spent a lot of my free time to do experiment in computer, especially anything related to low-level computing. I mainly code in C, C++, Go, & PHP but I would love to learn other languages.

I am student, and maybe will be a student for a long time... I got many experience in coding, especially web-related stuff but I would love to learn more in more fields. I have created many projects before but most of them have been deleted or lost
